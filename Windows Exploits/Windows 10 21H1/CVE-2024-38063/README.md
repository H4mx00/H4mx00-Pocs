# PoC for CVE-2024-38063: Windows Kernel Vulnerability

## Overview
CVE-2024-38063 is a vulnerability in the Windows Kernel that allows local attackers to escalate their privileges on affected systems. This vulnerability is caused by improper handling of objects in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-38063
- **Severity**: High
- **Attack Vector**: Local
- **Exploit Type**: Privilege Escalation, Arbitrary Code Execution
- **Affected Systems**: Various Windows versions, including Windows 10 and Windows Server (specific versions may vary; verify per Microsoftâ€™s official advisory).

## Requirements
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access to the target system. Key requirements include:
- Administrative privileges or local access to execute the exploit.
- Knowledge of kernel structures and memory manipulation techniques.

## Exploit Steps
### Step 1: Set up the Vulnerable Environment
Ensure the test environment runs a vulnerable version of Windows. The configurations include:
- **OS Version**: Windows 10 **21H1 19043.928**
- **Patch Level**: Ensure the system does not have security updates installed that patch this vulnerability.

### Step 2: Exploitation Steps
1. **Trigger the Vulnerability**: Utilize a crafted payload to manipulate the kernel's handling of objects in memory.
    - This generally involves using custom scripts or tools designed to exploit the memory handling flaw.
2. **Corrupt Kernel Memory**: Gain control over a privileged kernel object by exploiting the vulnerability.
3. **Escalate Privileges**: Execute code at the SYSTEM level by manipulating memory structures.

## Testing and Validation
1. **Compile and Run the Exploit**:
   ```bash
   gcc CVE-2024-38063.c -o CVE-2024-38063.exe
   CVE-2024-38063.exe
